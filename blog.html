              <strong>The difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.</strong> The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB. As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually. The client  can only read local storage.There are fewer old browsers that support it.On the other hand,the storage capacity of session storage is 5MB.It’s session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed.There is no transfer of data to the server.

              <strong>The scope of a variable defines where it’s accessible in a program based off of where it was created.</strong>Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope. A local variable is only accessible where it’s declared.

              <strong> The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous 
                programming.</strong> JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a 
                few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
                The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the 
                Callback Queue or Message Queue. 
                If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event from the
                Callback queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. 
                Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. 
                Each event is just a function callback.
